- **Front-End** is my strongest part. Currently working with [React](https://github.com/facebook/react/),  HTML, CSS, [Uikit](https://getuikit.com/docs/).

- **Back-End** is what Iâ€™m learning. I have a good experience in [Django](https://github.com/django/).

- **Databases** is what I respect. [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org), [MongoDB](https://ww w.mongodb.com).

- **CI/CD** is my passion. Github Actions, Gitlab CI, Travis, CircleCI, TeamCity.

- **DevOps** is what I think we all should do. Docker, Terraform, Ansible, Bash, Unix, Debian/Ubuntu, Nginx, Cron.
